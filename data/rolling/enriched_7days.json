Key incidents include a massive phone number exposure potentially exploited by scammers or hostile regimes, a verified breach of local government systems exposing sensitive police records, and active exploitation of a Fortinet zero-day vulnerability. Additionally, AT&T faced a data breach amid layoffs. The prevalence of exploits, leaks, and breaches across multiple sectors signals a trend of aggressive threat activity, particularly targeting critical infrastructure and personal data. Organizations should prioritize patching, incident response, and monitoring for suspicious access."

Additionally, a major exposure of phone numbers linked to key-reuse flaws raised concerns over unauthorized access, although data was later deleted. A separate incident involved the theft and leak of sensitive municipal and police records via a third-party server breach. The combination of severe vulnerabilities and data exposure incidents signals a high-risk environment requiring urgent attention and mitigation."
