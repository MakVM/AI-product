  "overallDayThreatScore": 85,
  "dailyBrief": "Cyber threat activity remains elevated, highlighted by active exploitation of a Chrome zero-day vulnerability with widespread impact, urging immediate updates by users. Additionally, a major exposure of phone numbers linked to key-reuse flaws raised concerns over unauthorized access, although data was later deleted. A separate incident involved the theft and leak of sensitive municipal and police records via a third-party server breach. The combination of severe vulnerabilities and data exposure incidents signals a high-risk environment requiring urgent attention and mitigation."
