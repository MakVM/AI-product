  "overallDayThreatScore": 85,
  "dailyBrief": "Today's cyber threat landscape is marked by two high-severity incidents: a zero-day Chrome exploit actively targeted by attackers and a municipal server breach exposing sensitive police records. Additionally, a significant phone number exposure highlights ongoing risks from flawed key management practices. Users should prioritize browser updates and monitor for public sector data leaks, as threat actors are exploiting both software vulnerabilities and misconfigured systems. The overall threat level is elevated, with active exploitation and widespread exposure risks."
