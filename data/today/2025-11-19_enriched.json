  "dailyBrief": "Today's cyber threat landscape shows a heightened level of risk, with several high-severity events reported. Key incidents include a massive phone number exposure potentially exploited by scammers or hostile regimes, a verified breach of local government systems exposing sensitive police records, and active exploitation of a Fortinet zero-day vulnerability. Additionally, AT&T faced a data breach amid layoffs. The prevalence of exploits, leaks, and breaches across multiple sectors signals a trend of aggressive threat activity, particularly targeting critical infrastructure and personal data. Organizations should prioritize patching, incident response, and monitoring for suspicious access."
