  "dailyBrief": "The day saw several high-impact cyber events, including a major phone number exposure with potential exploitation by scammers or regimes, and a significant breach affecting a municipality’s internal documents and police records. Both incidents indicate active exploitation and data exposure risks. Additionally, AT&T faced a data breach related to layoffs, and Fortinet patched a zero-day vulnerability being exploited in the wild. The overall threat level is high, with multiple breaches and verified exploits targeting both public and private sectors. Organizations should remain vigilant, prioritize patching, and review data protection measures."
